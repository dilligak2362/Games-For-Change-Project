     * there is an array of fullTexts that contain each box of dialogue for a character.
     * have a while loop go through the fullTexts[]; while iteration i that you define 
     * before is not greater than fullTexts[].length.
     * do the type writer effect as used in the tutorial https://youtu.be/1qbjmb_1hV4
     * if(user clicks a certain key AND letters are done loading) then iteration i ++ for the while loop to
     * load in the next full text set
     * after the while loop, dialogue box should close and spirit should disintegrate (animation) - this can
     * be done in the scene manager
